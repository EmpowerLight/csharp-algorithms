# CSharp-Algorithms

Welcome to the CSharp-Algorithms repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing algorithms in C#. Here, you'll find implementations of various algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques in C#, along with explanations and examples.

## Introduction

Algorithms are fundamental building blocks in computer science and software development. They are essential for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of algorithms implemented in C#, catering to both beginners and experienced developers.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following:
- Array manipulation operations
- Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.)
- Data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Dynamic programming solutions
- And more!
